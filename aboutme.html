<h3>
About Me</h3>
<p>I am a third year Cinema and Digital Media student, in the University Honors Program, at the University of California, Davis.
<br> I was born and raised in Chico, California and always enjoyed spending 
<br>time in the outdoors. Currently, I am the assistant producer for the 
<br>2017 UC Davis Film Festival, where I work to gather funds for the festival, 
<br>as well as plan events and film screenings. I established the UC Davis chapter
<br> of the national organization, React to Film, networking and collaborating with 
<br>other clubs , students, and faculty on campus to host engaging documentary screenings. I am also a filmmaker, and had my short documentary, Life Cycles (2016), play at the 2016 UC Davis Film festival. I was a marketing intern for the 2016 Davis Feminist Film Festival,
<br> and created the festivalâ€™s trailer. As a part of the University Honors Program, I have worked closely with faculty and other Honors students for the past three years, and have had an 
<br>opportunity to work in a more rigorous academic environment. I enjoy cooking, and co-hosted 
<br>two cooking classes at the International House, and won the 2015 UC Davis Food Championship. 
<br>I am now a multimedia intern for Strategic Communications, where I works as a videographer 
<br>for UC Davis marketing, where I create videos about students, administration, 
<br>and the benefits of attending UC Davis.
